# This file will contain the variable definitions for your module.
# When your module is used by others, the variables will be configured as arguments
# in the module block. Since all Terraform values must be defined, any variables that
# are not given a default value will become required arguments. Variables with default
# values can also be provided as module arguments, overriding the default value.
